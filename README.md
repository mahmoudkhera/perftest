`perftest` is a **high-performance TCP benchmarking tool** written in Rust.  
It allows you to measure **throughput, latency, and stability** of network connections, inspired by tools like `iperf3`, but built in Rust for **speed, safety, and modern async design**.

# Acknowledgments

At first, I would like to thank [Eng. Ahmed Soliman](https://github.com/ahmedsoliman)
for his excellent tutorial on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLald6EODoOJU0GMuYHlkS9MLhTPE7HiaT&si=Xs0skuHh32vg-O1G) that helped me a lot,
and for his reverse engineering repo for i perf3 , which inspired me to write my own network performance tool.
Since I was learning, I decided to rebuild the tool in my own style  upon his  repo [netperf](https://github.com/AhmedSoliman/netperf.git) as part of my learning journey.


## âœ¨ Features

-  Measure TCP throughput between a client and server  
-  Support for multiple parallel streams (`-P`)  
-  Efficient design using Rust async/runtime    
-  Memory-safe implementation compared to legacy C tools

 #  Limitations
